# AI-agent-based-Deep-Research
Deep Research AI Agents are intelligent systems designed to automate complex research workflows.
They operate through a multi-agent architecture where each agent specializes in a task — such as data gathering, summarization, validation, and answer drafting.
Using advanced retrieval, reasoning, and language models, these agents can autonomously:

Collect accurate, up-to-date information from trusted sources

Cross-verify facts across multiple documents

Summarize lengthy content into concise, actionable insights

Draft high-quality research outputs in natural language

The system ensures reliability, transparency, and efficiency, enabling users to perform deep technical, academic, or market research faster and with greater confidence.

This project leverages technologies like LangChain, Tavily, and LangGraph to build autonomous, highly capable agents with memory, reasoning, and retrieval abilities

# Features
Dual-Agent System:

Research Agent: Retrieves data from the web using Tavily, returning structured results including the title, content, and URL.

Draft Agent: Utilizes a large language model (LLM) to generate structured summaries, organizing the output into sections like Research Summary, Key Findings, Analysis, and Conclusion.

Structured Summaries: Produces organized summaries divided into clearly labeled sections—Research Summary, Key Findings, Analysis, and Conclusion—to enhance readability and comprehension.

Customizable Settings:

Writing Style: Choose from Academic, Casual, Technical, and more.
Export Formats: Download outputs as PDF, Word, Markdown, or plain text.
Citation Format: Support for APA, MLA, IEEE, etc.
Word Count: Set a target length for your report.

PDF Report Download:
Enables users to download a well-formatted PDF report, including the query, research data, and structured summary, with proper text wrapping and multi-page support for readability.

User Feedback: Integrates an interactive sidebar form for users to submit suggestions and help improve the system.
